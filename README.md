# React Simple Store

A simple store simulation built with React to practice `useState` and `useEffect`. Users can browse products, add them to a cart, and view the total price. This project is designed for learning React hooks in a beginner-friendly way.

## Features
- Display a list of products.
- Add products to a shopping cart.
- View total price calculation.
- Store cart data in `localStorage` (optional).
- Fetch product data from a JSON file or API (optional).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Espadv69/React-Simple-Store.git
   cd React-Simple-Store
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technologies Used
- React
  - Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (or your preferred styling approach)

## Learning Goals
- Understand `useState` for state management.
- Use `useEffect` for side effects like fetching data.
- Handle user interactions (adding/removing items from the cart).
